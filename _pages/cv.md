# Current Employment

University of Manchester March 2019 - present
Postdoctoral Researcher, Robotics for Extreme Environments Group.

I am working with Sellafield Ltd, Britain's first commercial nuclear power station, to develop robotic platforms that can be used on-site for monitoring of legacy facilities. I am taking a low TRL project to a high TRL, and working to enhance existing capabilities and provide further features. In 2019 I deployed a version of this platform for indoor monitoring of a legacy facility on the Sellafield site. I am also guiding the commercialisation of the robotic platform, alongside Nuvia Ltd.

Throughout the project, I have been working closely with our customers at Sellafield Ltd to ensure delivery of the robotic platform, and I have recently been involved in a workshop to guide the adoption of robotic platforms more widely on site.

# Technical Skills

- I am proficient in the use of Linux, Bash, Python, MATLAB, C++ and git
  source control.

- Using the Robot Operating System (ROS) to implement autonomous
  navigation solutions in outdoor inspection environment and Gazebo
  for simulating outdoor environments.

- Integration of open-source and existing algorithms on a robotic platform, including
  state-machine methods to allow mission planning and more complex robot behaviours.

- Use of AngularJS and other web technologies to create a user-interface to communicate
  with ROS, allowing the control of the robotic platform from non-Linux devices.

- Applied machine Learning / AI using Caffe, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn.

- Use of Docker and Singularity to create containers to create repeatable
  instances of my work that could also be ported to a remote computer, such as the
  High performance computing on the Leeds ARC3 system, which I used to train
  Deep-Learning models for the detection of cracks in images of roads and pavements.

- Building hardware, electronics and programming robots for use in
  difficult outdoor environments.

- Worked with different platforms including the ClearPath Jackal, Husky and AnyBotics
  Anymal legged robot.

- Implementation of different technologies and sensors including:
  stereo cameras, LiDARs (2D and 3D) on different robotic platforms.

I am also a trained member of the Software Carpentries and run workshops
to help others use tools such as Python, Unix and git to increase the
repeatability of their scientific outputs.

# Education

University of Leeds UK
PhD - Robots for bridge bearing inspection September 2015 - March 2019

- Supervisors: Professor Anthony G. Cohn, Dr Raul Fuentes.
- Part of the self-repairing cities project (http://selfrepairingcities.com/)
- Funded by ESPRC and the University of Leeds.
- My PhD focused on the development and operation of autonomous robots for
  inspection of bridges. Deep learning and AI for visual inspection tasks, including
  segmentation of cracks in images of concrete.

University of Bristol UK
MEng (Hons) Aeronautical Engineering (1st class) 2011-2015

- Final year project: Efficient implementation of computational fluid dynamics for modelling vortices around aircraft wing tips.
- Relevant modules: Satellite mechanics and space, robot dynamics, aerodynamics, UAV system design, energy generation for 21st century.

# Internship

**BAE Systems (Internship), 2014:** A three month internship including
work for the heads of discipline in Aerodynamics, Aircraft Structures,
Aircraft Systems and Research disciplines. My roles included
interviewing heads of department to find which tasks in an aircraft
design were most dependent on other disciplines to allow better
modelling of aircraft systems.

# Competitions and Summer Schools

**Resilient Infrastructure Robotics Challenge 2017:** Team competition
addressing the inspection, repair and maintenance of critical
infrastructure and our solution to automation of vehicles in
construction sites. Our solution used a computer vision system on-board
a drone to monitor, track and direct small-scale construction vehicles
and was featured on the BBC documentary 'Invented in the North'.

**ESPRC National Intelligent Robotics Prototyping Workshop, 2016**: As
part of a team at this workshop I built a robot for detecting and
carrying objects to a user. During this workshop, I was featured in a
video that was published by the University of Leeds.

**Summer School, 2016**: I attended the British Machine Vision
Association (BVMA) summer school in 2016 on computer vision, machine
learning, AI and its applications.

**Communications Training** I was selected to attend a scientific
communications masterclass led by Dr Maggie Aderin-Pollock.

# Public Speaking and Scientific Outreach

- **Industry Outreach:** I presented at SPRINT robotics conference in 2019.
  During my PhD I also resented a stall at Digital Construction
  Week 2017 and Eco-build 2018 at the ExceL Arena, London for public
  and special interest groups to inform and educate about the role of
  robotics in the construction sector.

- **Event Organisation:** I organised a 24 hour Hackathon in Financial
  Technology at the University of Leeds with industry partners
  (including PWC and YBS).

- I organised an academic conference to celebrate the Robotics research
  carried out at the University of Leeds.

- **Scientific Speaking:** I presented work at the Royal Academy of
  Engineering Research Forum in London, 2017.

- I presented my work on navigation for bridge inspection robots at two
  international conferences.

- **Scientific Outreach:** I participated in events for school
  children including events to teach school girls to program and
  general school robotics events.
