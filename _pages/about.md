I am a Final Year PhD student at the University of Leeds.

Inspection of civil infrastructure can be very challenging; it can often be hard to access.
In my research I have been using robotics and AI to perform inspection of bridge bearings. 

I have also been involved in the [self-repairing cities project](http://selfrepairingcities.com/) at the Univeristy of Leeds. As part of this project I have been using AI to detect cracks in concrete, which contributes to the use of drones for inspection and repair of roads (see videos page).
