I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Robotics for Extreme Environments Group at the Universtity of Manchester [REEG at Manchester](http://uomrobotics.com/index.html). In my current role, I am designing, building, developing and commercialising a robotic ground platform to perform automated surveying of legacy nuclear facilities. I have also contributed to the build and development of a reconfigurable robot for access into potentially contaminated facilities through a 5inch access port. For more details about both of these project see [videos page](https://pinpea.github.io/harrietpeel/portfolio/). [CARMA](http://uomrobotics.com/nuclear/roboticplatforms/autonomous%20exploration/carma.html) and [MiRRAX](http://uomrobotics.com/nuclear/roboticplatforms/autonomous%20exploration/mirrax150.html). 
These projects are supported by the UK Robotics and AI in Nuclear Hub [RAIN](https://rainhub.org.uk/research/overview/). 


In my PhD I used robotics and AI to perform inspection of bridge bearings and other civil infrastructure. For more information see [see videos page](https://pinpea.github.io/harrietpeel/portfolio/) and [my publications](https://pinpea.github.io/harrietpeel/publications/).  

I have also been involved in the [self-repairing cities project](http://selfrepairingcities.com/) at the Univeristy of Leeds. As part of this project I have been using AI to detect cracks in concrete, which contributes to the use of drones for inspection and repair of roads [see videos page](https://pinpea.github.io/harrietpeel/portfolio/).
